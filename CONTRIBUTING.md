## Team Norms

### Naming Conventions

### Group Meetings

The group should aim to meet at least every 2 hours. Prior to meetings, group member should commit their code locally and pull from master.

Any group member can call a meeting at any time they deem necessary.

### Follow Good Git Workflow

- Name your branches based on the feature you are working on
- Commit often
- Never merge your own code into master
- Message your reviewer (@ comment) so they know to review and comment on your code
- Never push code to origin without associated tests

Be willing to stretch
